PokerBot
========

Automatic intelligent playing bot for PokerStars. Still in its infancy, only component done so far is the hand evaluator.
Started it a couple years back, and I haven't got the time to touch it again since, so it's been on hiatus.


Included here is Keith Rule's C# Port of the Pokersource Evaluator, which I used to test my own odds evalutor.
